Welcome to the AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT) documentation!
============================================================

The AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (Formerly the Bespoke Links to Instruments for Surface and Space (BLISS)) is a Python-based software suite developed to handle Ground Data System (GDS), Electronic Ground Support Equipment (EGSE), commanding, telemetry uplink/downlink, and sequencing for JPL International Space Station and CubeSat Missions. It is a generalization and expansion of tools developed for the following JPL ISS projects:

* `Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) <http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov>`_
* `Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM) <http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/35.html>`_
* `ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) <http://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov>`_

Visit the :doc:`Installation and Environment Configuration <installation>` guide for installation information. Visit the :doc:`API Documentation <bliss>` page to view in-depth interface documentation.

.. note:: The AMMOS Instrument Toolkit was formerly known as "BLISS". You will see references to this, especially in the :doc:`API Documentation <bliss>` and code snippets, since the internal software structure still maintains that provenance.
