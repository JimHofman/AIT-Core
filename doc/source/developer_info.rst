Release Process
---------------

Prepare Repo for Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. *Determine the version number for the release. **bliss-core** uses standard semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch).

* Major bumps are for large, non-backwards compatible changes
* Minor bumps are for backwards compatible changes
* Patch bumps are for incremental bug fixes, small releases, and end-of-sprint releases.

2. *Update the project documentation to use the correct version names.* The following files needs to be updated with the correct version names:

* `doc/source/conf.py <https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/bliss/bliss-core/blob/master/doc/source/conf.py>`_ - contains a **version** and **release** option. Both of these should be updated to point to the version number for this release.

.. code-block:: python

    # The short X.Y version.
    version = u'0.29.0'
    # The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.
    release = u'0.29.0

* `setup.py <https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/bliss/bliss-core/blob/master/setup.py>`_ - The setup object and bottom of script also contains the **version**.

.. code-block:: python

   setup(
       name = 'bliss-core',
       version = '0.29.0'
       .
       .
   )

3. Commit and push these changes.

.. code-block:: bash

   git add doc/source/conf.py setup.py
   git commit -m "Prep for <version> release"
   git push origin master

See a past release `commit <https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/bliss/bliss-core/commit/0503789dadfcfdeec450fd3cf3165f7bcfe05bfb>`_ for an example.

Generate Release Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need a list of included tickets to put the in tag annotation when tagging the release. There is a helper script in /build that will generate this for you. Note that you can include a start and end time to help narrow down the notes to include since the last release made.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd build
   ./generate_changelog.py --start-time YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

Tag the Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Via the Github Releases page, draft a new release. Place the above version number as the tag version. The release title should be **BLISS v<version number>**. Copy the change log into the release description box. If the release is not production ready be sure to check the pre-release box to note that. When finished, publish the release.

Push Latest Docs to Github Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to push the latest documentation to Github pages for the release. There is a script that helps you with the majority of this.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd build
   ./update_docs_release.sh
   git status # Check that everything looks correct
   git commit -m "Update docs for <version>"
   git push origin gh-pages
   git checkout master
