Bespoke Links to Instruments for Surface and Space (BLISS)
==========================================================

The Bespoke Links to Instruments for Surface and Space (BLISS) framework is a
Python-based software suite developed to handle Ground Data System (GDS),
Electronic Ground Support Equipment (EGSE), commanding,
telemetry uplink/downlink, and sequencing for JPL International Space Station
Missions. It is a generalization and expansion of tools developed for the
following JPL ISS projects:

* [Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3)](http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov)
* [Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM)](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/35.html)
* [ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS)](http://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov)
