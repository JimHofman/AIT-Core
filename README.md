Bespoke Links to Instruments for Surface and Space (BLISS)
==========================================================

The Bespoke Links to Instruments for Surface and Space (BLISS) Ground Data
System (GDS) tools are a generalization of those developed for the
following JPL ISS projects:

  * [Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor (VCAM)](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/35.html)

  * [Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3)](http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov)

  * [ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS)](http://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov)

Currently, the OCO-3 GDS tools are far ahead of the ECOSTRESS GDS
tools, but as the OCO-3 tools are generalized and made more
configurable, they'll be brought over to this repository.
